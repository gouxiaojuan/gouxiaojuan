## Hi there 👋

I am Xiaojuan Gou, a bioinformatics researcher

## About me
I am a Ph.D. student at Huazhong Agricultural University (HZAU), China, with research interests in bioinformatics data analysis and software development. My current work focuses on single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics data analysis, as well as applications in neurobiology and immunology.

During my Ph.D., I participated in a visiting research program at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), where I expanded my expertise in epigenomics, including ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and CUT&RUN data analysis, applied various approaches to investigate the conservation of regulatory elements across species, and learned to apply deep learning methods to biological data analysis.
